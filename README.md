# What is it?
A simple remake of the BMI160 module that you can find online, except that this one uses only parts from LCSC.

# How do I make one?
Simply navigate to the OSHWLAB website linked above, scroll down to the PCB design, and select "Open in Editor". Now, inside the EasyEDA editor, select "File" in the top left corner and then select "Generate Gerber Files". The website should now give you an option to order them from JLCPCB, which I recommend doing. After that, select the PCB Assembly service from JLCPCB and order your boards. Wait a few days, and enjoy!
